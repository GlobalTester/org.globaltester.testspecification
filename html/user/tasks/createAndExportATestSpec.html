	<h1>Create and Export a TestSpecification</h1>
	<p>
	In a few steps, this user guide will show you how to create and export a TestSpecification.
	In order to get a quick overview, you can also use the Cheat Sheet.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Create your own TestSpecification</h2>
	<p>
	With GlobalTester 3 you cannot only use imported <a href="../concepts/TestSpecification.html">TestSpecifications</a>,
	but you can also write your own.
	You can also share it with the GlobalTester Community if you like to.<br></br> 
	First, go with the mouse courser in the &quot;GlobalTester Navigator&quot; window.
	You might already have some TestSpecifications or TestCampaigns created there.
	Right-click, and choose <b>&quot;New -> Project...&quot;</b>.<br></br>
    In the &quot;New Project&quot; wizard, select <b>&quot;GlobalTester -> TestSpecification&quot;</b>, and click <b>&quot;Next &gt;&quot;</b>.
    Enter a name for your TestSpecification Project in the text field <b>&quot;Project name&quot;</b>.
    If the name typed in the field is already existing in your GlobalTester 3 runtime workspace, you will be notified.<br></br>
    Then click <b>&quot;Finish&quot;</b>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Add a TestCase</h2>
	<p>
	In the &quot;GlobalTester Navigator&quot; window, your own TestSpecification will be shown as a project folder.
    In its sub-folder TestCases, you can now add a default TestCase that will select the master file: <br></br>
    Go with the mouse courser in the &quot;GlobalTester Navigator&quot; window and choose the <b>&quot;TestCases&quot;</b> folder.
    Right-click, and choose <b>&quot;New -> Other...&quot;</b>.<br></br>
    In the &quot;New&quot; wizard, select <b>&quot;GlobalTester -> TestCase&quot;</b>, and click <b>&quot;Next &gt;&quot;</b>.
    Enter a name for your TestCase in the text field <b>&quot;File name&quot;</b>.
    Then click <b>&quot;Finish&quot;</b><br>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Write a TestCase</h2>
	<p>
    You can use this default TestCase as a basis for your own TestCase.
    It already comprises the XML structure it is supposed to have in order to be executable.
    You can find an example of how to send an APDU command and evaluate its response in it, i.e. status word and response data.<br></br>
    For further and specific information, have a look at the User Guide <a href="../tasks/WriteATestCase.html">&quot;Write TestCases&quot;</a>,
	and also the <a href="../reference/XMLStructureForTestCases.html">XML structure for TestCases</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Add TestCase Data</h2>
	<p>
	If you need any own card-verifiable certificates, you can specify them in the &quot;Test Data -> Certificates&quot; folder
	using the <a href="../reference/XMLStructureForCertificates.html">XML structure for Certificates</a>.<br></br>
	You can create and your own <a href="../concepts/Subroutines.html">Subroutines</a> and use them in you TestCase(s) as well.
