	<h1>Write a TestCase</h1>
	<p>
	In a few steps, this user guide will show you how to write a basic <a href="../concepts/TestCase.html">TestCase</a>.
	You will be given references for further details. Basic Java Script and and SmartCardShell Usage is of advantage.
	You can use the default TestCase that selects the master file as a template.<br>
    In the sub-folder TestCases of you TestSpecification, 
	right-click with you mouse, and choose <b>&quot;New -&gt; Other...&quot;</b>.<br>
    In the &quot;New&quot; wizard, select <b>&quot;GlobalTester -&gt; TestCase&quot;</b>, and click <b>&quot;Next &gt;&quot;</b>.
    Enter a name for your TestCase in the text field <b>&quot;File name&quot;</b>.
    Then click <b>&quot;Finish&quot;</b><br>
	</p>
	
	<h2>The TestCase structure</h2>
	<p>
	The TestCase is written in an <a href="../reference/XMLStructureForTestCases.html">XML structure</a>.
	These are the most important things you have to consider:
	</p>
	
	<h3>Profiles</h3>
	<p>
	You can list the profiles your TestCase fits to in the according tag.
	When your TestCase is carried over in a TestCampaign and this is executed,
	you have to select the according profile in order to have your TestCase executed.
	If you assign no profile to your TestCase, your TestCase will be executed in any case.
	</p>
	
	<h3>ActionSteps</h3>
	<p>
	A TestCase is executed in ActionSteps.
	There are three types of ActionSteps: <a href="../concepts/TestCase.html#PreCondition">PreCondition</a>,
	<a href="../concepts/TestCase.html#TestStep">TestStep</a>, and <a href="../concepts/TestCase.html#PostCondition">PostCondition</a>.<br>
	Each of them is organized in tags according to the <a href="../reference/XMLStructureForTestCases.html">XML structure for TestCases</a>.
	If you write your TestCase with the default one as a template, just adjust your tags accordingly.
	Note that there can be several TestSteps, so you can copy this tag template as often as you need TestSteps. 
	</p>
	
	<h4>Using the JavaScript scope - sending commands</h4>
	<p>
	All communication in a TestCase is handled in the same JavaScript scope that uses a GlobalPlatform card object provided by the SmartCardShell. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In the <b>TechnicalCommand</b> tag, you can set variables, call Java Script functions, and send APDU commands.
	Setting Variables is pretty straightforward, for example <code>var P1 = "83";</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can use the SmartCardShell &quot;card&quot; object to call functions, for example <code>card.reset();</code>.<br>
	GlobalTester offers you a variety of own implementations that can be called with and <code>gt_</code> prefix,
	for example <code>card.gt_getCardConfig("ICAO9303","MRZ");</code>.<br>
	There are several protocols and scopes you can use as well, for example ISO 7816, Basic Access Control (BAC),
	Extended Access Control (EAC), Supplemental Access Control (SAC), and so on.
	You can call them with <code>card.gt_PROTOCOL_COMMAND();</code>, with <code>PROTOCOL</code> being the abbreviation of the protocol
	(for example <code>ISO7816</code> or <code>BAC</code>),
	and <code>COMMAND</code> a command that has been implemented (for example <code>selectAID</code> or <code>selectApplicationEPASS</code>).
	So your function call could be <code>card.gt_ISO7816_selectAID(aid);</code> (where AID is a variable that has been previously set)
	or <code>card.gt_BAC_selectApplicationEPASS();</code>.<br>
	
	</p>
	<p>
	If you want to send an APDU, you can do that in the &quot;Command&quot; tag as an APDUCommand.
	Here is an example of one:<br>
	<code>&lt;Command xsi:type="APDUCommand"&gt;<br>
			&lt;Text&gt;Select the ePassport application with a plain SELECT Application APDU&lt;/Text&gt;<br>
			&lt;APDU sm=&quot;false&quot;&gt;00 A4 04 00 {lc} {aid} 00&lt;/APDU&gt;<br>
		&lt;/Command&gt;</code><br>
	As you can see, the APDU is enclosed in the &quot;APDU&quot; tag.
	The sm flag indicates if Secure Messaging should be used or not.
	The APDU is written as byte string.<br>
	There are two variables used, <code>lc</code> and <code>aid</code>.<br>
	The variable <code>aid</code> can be set in the &quot;TechnicalCommand&quot; tag.
	This tag will be evaluated at first, so you can set variables there for the Java Script code,
	and then the &quot;APDU&quot; tag will use them.<br>
	The variable <code>lc</code> always encodes the length of the directly following element.
	If necessary, it will be transformed to an ExtendedLength field according to ISO 7816.<br>
	You can also build constructed TLV structures with the {}-braces:
	If you put in two values separated with a comma,
	the first one will be interpreted as tag, and the second as value.
	The length will be automatically completed.<br>
	If you nest one {}-expression in another, you can build constructed TLV structures.   
	</p>
	<p>
	Sometimes a TestCase requires that you send an erroneous APDU.
	You can achieve this if you define an APDU as ByteString in the &quot;TechnicalCommand&quot; tag
	(for example <br>
	<code>var command = new ByteString("00 B0 83 00 01", HEX);</code>),<br>
	and then send it using the GlobalTester send Command function (<code>card.gt_sendCommand(command);</code>).
	</p>
	
	<h4>Using the Java Script scope - evaluating commands</h4>
	<p>
	When you send a command APDU to the chip, its response APDU is logged in the variable <code>response</code>;
	in the &quot;TechnicalResult&quot; tag (which is nested in the &quot;APDUResult&quot; tag, an extension of the ExpectedResult).<br>
	There you can evaluate its data and status words with <code>assertStatusWord</code> and <code>assertMatchValue</code>.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Specifying TestData</h4>
	<p>
	If you need any <a href="../concepts/Certificates.html">certificates</a> or any other test data,
	you can store it in the folder &quot;TestData&quot; of your TestSpecification.
	You must reference it in the &quot;TestDataReference&quot; tag.
