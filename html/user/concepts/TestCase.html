	<h1>TestCase</h1>
	<p>
	A TestCase is an XML file. The XML structure is a further development of the new German BSI XML structure
	that can be used to either execute the TestCases or use them to create a human-readable test specification in the Open Document Format.<br>
	TestCase are structured in the so called &quot;ActionSteps&quot;: <b>PreCondition</b>, <b>TestStep</b>s, and <b>PostCondition</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	ActionSteps can encapsulate simple APDU commands,
	or call more complex Java Script functions that may use variables that have been defined in the ActionSteps or predefined globally.
	All APDUs, their responses, variables and functions are evaluated in the same Java Script scope.
	So if for example one ActionStep sets a variable, a following ActionStep still has access to that variable.
	predefined variables can also be used.
	</p>
	<p>
	A PreCondition may be a state of the card or simulator that can be achieved by performing some operations before the
	TestSteps are performed.
	</p>
	<p>
	In TestSteps, the actual purpose of the TestCase will be implemented.<br>
	A TestStep may cover one major step of a TestCase, for example &quot;Perform BAC&quot;, &quot;Read Data Group XY&quot;,
	&quot;Select Application Z&quot;, and so on.<br>
	Sometimes the TestSpecification requires a finer granularity, for example if an erroneous APDU is sent,
	and the according response APDU shall be checked.
	Examples are &quot;MSE: Set AT&quot;, &quot;General Authenticate&quot;, &quot;PSO: Verify Certificate&quot;, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	A PostCondition may be a state of the card or simulator that should be achieved after the TestSteps are performed.
	To ensure this condition, several commands can be sent and their responses be checked.
	If the results comply to the ones that this certain state of the chip is supposed to send back,
	the PostCondition is fulfilled.
	</p>
	<p>
	TestCases will be executed in a Java Script scope.<br>
	PreCondition, TestSteps, and PostCondition will be organized in XML tags.
	In those, variables can be set in the Java Script scope , Java Script functions called, and plain APDUs sent (even incorrect ones).
	Status words and response data can be checked using assertions.
	</p>
	<p>
	The profiles defined for each TestCase matter in the execution of a TestCampaign:
	Only those TestCases that match the selected profiles will be executed.
