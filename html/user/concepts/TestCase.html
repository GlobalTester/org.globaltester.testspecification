	<h1>TestCase</h1>
	<p>
	A TestCase is an XML file that conforms to the german BSI XML structure.
	It will be structured in <b>PreCondition</b>, <b>TestStep</b>s, and <b>PostCondition</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Communication between the chip or simulator and reader or prover in PreCondition, TestSteps, and PostCondition
	will be organized in tags as described for the XML structure.
	</p>
	<p>
	A PreCondition may be a state of the card or simulator that can be achieved by performing some operations before the
	TestSteps (that is the purpose of the TestCase) are performed.
	</p>
	<p>
	In TestSteps, the actual purpose TestCase will be implemented.
	</p>
	<p>
	A PostCondition may be a state of the card or simulator that should be achieved after the TestSteps are performed.
