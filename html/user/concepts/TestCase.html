	<h1>TestCase</h1>
	<p>
	A TestCase is an XML file. The XML structure is a further development of the new German BSI XML structure.
	It will be structured in the so called &quot;ActionSteps&quot;: <b>PreCondition</b>, <b>TestStep</b>s, and <b>PostCondition</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
	ActionSteps can encapsulate simple APDU commands,
	or call more complex java script functions that may use variables that have been defined in them. 
	</p>
	<p>
	A PreCondition may be a state of the card or simulator that can be achieved by performing some operations before the
	TestSteps are performed.
	</p>
	<p>
	In TestSteps, the actual purpose of the TestCase will be implemented.<br></br>
	A TestStep may cover one major step of a TestCase, for example &quot;Perform BAC&quot;, &quot;Read Data Group XY&quot;,
	&quot;Select Application Z&quot;, and so on.<br></br>
	Sometimes the TestSpecification requires a finer granularity, for example if an erroneous APDU is sent,
	and the according response APDU shall be checked.
	Examples are &quot;MSE: Set AT&quot;, &quot;General Authenticate&quot;, &quot;PSO: Verify Certificate&quot;, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	A PostCondition may be a state of the card or simulator that should be achieved after the TestSteps are performed.
	To ensure this condition, several commands can be sent and their responses be checked.
	If the results comply to the ones that this certain state of the chip is supposed to send back,
	the PostCondition is fulfilled.
	</p>
	<p>
	PreCondition, TestSteps, and PostCondition will be organized in the following tags: 
	<ul>
	<li><b>Command</b> gives the &quot;ActionStep&quot; a title; or <b>APDUCommand</b> may specify an APDU to send in addition.
		Variables that might be used here can be set in the &quot;TechnicalCommand&quot; tag.</li>
	<li><b>Description</b> is a textual description of what happens in this step.</li>
	<li><b>TechnicalCommand</b> may
		<ul>
		<li>set variables in the Java Script scope,</li>
		<li>call Java Script functions, and</li>
		<li>send APDU (declaration as ByteString and using the send command function).</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><b>ExpectedResult</b> will evaluate the response data stored in the variable &quot;response&quot;.
		Status words and response data can be checked using assertions.</li>
	</ul>
