	<h1>XML structure for TestCases</h1>

	<p>	
	A <a href="../concepts/TestCase.html">TestCase</a> is structured in these XML tags:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>id</b>: ID of the test case.
	<li><b>Title</b>: The Title of the TestCase. It should correspond to the title of the test case in its according test specification.</li>
	<li><b>Version</b>: The version number the test case has according to its TestSpecification.</li>
	<li><b>Purpose</b>: A short description of the purpose of the test case.</li>
	<li><b>Profile</b>: A TestSpecification often defines profiles. Each test case has some of them assigned to. They will be listed in this tag.</li>
	<li><b>Reference</b> (optional): References can be listed in this tag, for example the technical guideline the test specification is based on.</li>
	<li><b>PreCondition</b> (optional)</li>
	<li><b>TestStep</b> (several possible)</li>
	<li><b>PostConditions</b> (optional)</li>
	<li><b>MetaData</b>: This tag contains meta information in form of key-value pairs, for example if a test case is destructive.</li>
	<li><b>Comment</b>: If a test case was deleted in a later version of the test specification, this will be explained in this tag.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	PreCondition, TestSteps and PostConditions are organized in the following tags:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Command</b>: A tag that gives the test step a title, i.e. &quot;Reset Card&quot;, encapsulated in a &lt;text&gt; tag.<br>
		An <b>APDUCommand</b> is a special command that additionally specifies an APDU that will be sent in an &lt;apdu&gt; tag
	</li>
	<li><b>Description</b> (optional): A short description of the purpose of the test step.</li>
	<li><b>TechnicalCommand</b> (optional): In this tag the concrete implementation of the textual description takes place. There can be 
		<ul>
		<li>Variables set within the Java Script scope,</li>
		<li>functions called within the Java Script scope, or</li>
		<li>APDUs declared as ByteString and sent.</li>
		</ul>
		Please note: Variables that may be used in the APDUCommand are set in the TechnicalCommand.
		Thus, the TechnicalCommand will be evaluated first in the Java Script scope, and then the APDUCommand will be executed.
	<li><b>TestDataReference</b> (optional): In this tag reference to some predefined test data, such as certificates, can be made.</li>
	<li><b>ExpectedResult</b>: In this tag the result APDU can be verified, i.e. its status words and response data (if any) can be checked.
			It is structured in two possible tags as well:
			<ul>
			<li><b>Text</b>: Gives a short textual description of the expected result, i.e. &quot;SW 9000&quot; if the status word 9000 is expected.</li>
			<li><b>TechnicalResult</b>: Status words and response data can be checked in assertions.</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
