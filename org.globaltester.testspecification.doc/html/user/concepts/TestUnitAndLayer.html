	<h1>TestUnits and TestLayers</h1>
	<p>
	TestUnits and Layers are XML-structures, which are used to group different collections of <a href="../reference/XMLStructureForTestCases.html">TestCases</a>.
	This XML-Structures are an enhanced Version of the formerly used TestSuites (which are still supported by the GlobalTester). 
	TestUnits are used to reference on TestCase files while TestLayers reference on TestUnit files. 
	This is normally used to test on different layers within one test session.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The structure of these files is quite simple. A TestUnit (root tag <b>TestUnit</b>) contains a <b>Text</b> tag and (one or more) <b>TestCase</b> tags which contains the path to the test files.
	The Text tag also contains a <b>Paragraph</b> Tag with an description of the Unit.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	TestLayers are implemented in a very similar way. A TestLayer (root tag <b>TestLayer</b>) also contains a <b>Text</b> tag. 
	This tag has a <b>Heading</b> tag to describe the Layer test. Instead of directly referencing TestCases it contains one or more <b>TestUnits</b> tags which reference to the previously mentioned TestUnit files.
