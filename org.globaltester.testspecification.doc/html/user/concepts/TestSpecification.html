	<h1>TestSpecification</h1>
	
	<p>
	A TestSpecification is a static collection of TestCases.
	Those are stored as XML files. The XML structure is based the new German BSI XML structure.<br>
	TestCases can be used to create a TestCampaign and be executed there. This is a pretty common approach.<br>
	But they also can be used to generate a human-readable test specification in the Open Document Format.
	So with the new XML structure, it is not at first a human-readable test specification that is then implemented in test cases,
	it is at first an executable XML file out of which the human-readable test specification can be generated if required.
	</p>
	<p>
	A TestSpecification often defines profiles.
	Each test case has some of them assigned to in the &quot;Profile&quot;-tag.
	</p>
	<p>
	All data needed for the TestCases (like <a href="Certificates.html">certificates</a>
	and <a href="Subroutines.html">subroutines</a>)
	will be stored in the TestSpecification as XML files as well.
