	<h1>Import of a TestSpecification</h1>
	<p>
	In a few steps, you will be able to import a TestSpecification.
	In order to get a quick overview, you can also use the Cheat Sheet.	
	</p>
	<h2>Open menu</h2>
	<p>
	First, move the mouse cursor into the &quot;GlobalTester Navigator&quot; window.
	You might already have some TestSpecifications or TestCampaigns created there.
	Right-click, and choose &quot;Import&quot;.
	The import wizard will open.
	</p>
	<h2>Select TestSpecification</h2>
	<p>
	In the tree view, select &quot;GlobalTester &gt; Import TestSpecification from Plugin&quot;.
	Click the &quot;Next&quot; button.
	</p>
	<h2>Choose the TestSpecification you want to import</h2>
	<p>
	In the list, you can choose the TestSpecification you want to import.
	Just below the list you will find the bundle symbolic name of the last selected TestSpecification.
	Also a description of the TestSpecification is given so that you can get a quick overview of its purpose.
	For the ease of use several TestSpecifications can be selected for import.
	If a TestSpecification with the same name is already present within your workspace you will be notified and asked to resolve this conflict.
	In this case you either can check the checkbox at the bottom of the page which will remove/delete all conflicting TestSpecifications from your workspace prior to importing the new ones.
	If you want to keep your existing TestSpecifications you are encouraged to rename them in your workspace manually prior to continuing with importing new TestSpecifications
	Then click &quot;Finish&quot;.
